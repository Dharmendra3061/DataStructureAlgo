# Stack implementation
Here, we have tried to implement the stack and its basic functionality using linked list.

## Stack
Stack is a data structure, which follows FILO (First In Last Out)/ LIFO (Last In First Out)
It has basic feasture like Push, Pop, Peek.
### Push
When we have to add item to stack, we perform push and it keeps the value of top as newly inserted item.
### Pop
When we have to remove item from stack, we have to perform pop and it move top to next available item on stack.
### Peek
Peek is used to traverse the stack items without removing or updating anything on it.

## How to run Stack program :
### Clone code at local system using git
### Move to Stacks directory
    cd Stacks
### Run command on terminal/CMD to build project
    dotnet build
### Run command on terminal/CMD to run project
    dotnet run
### It will generate below output
```
